# User friendly paper printer 

I have a project I want to put some effort towards: a 2D printer with no strings attached.

The world has been plagued by [crippleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crippleware), [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) printers for well over a decade now. A printer will stop functioning within months of purchase, just to get you to buy a new printer, a printer will refuse to allow ink cartridges designed for a different printer, or a different model of a printer. This has gone on for FAR too long.

I am willing to support an effort to have a company that produces long-lasting, free and open source printers. The main requirements are:

- The printer must consist of ONLY FLOSS software, with no proprietary bits
- The printer must accept any ink cartridge from any manufacturer
- The printer must be under $500 (for small printers, adjusted for 2022 December inflation levels) 

## Additional ideas (recommendations):

- No cartridges, just pour the ink into the printer (separate ink slots for separate ink colors, of course, unless mixing it would somehow work)

## Notes

- There may be one, two... or many companies that already do this, just not very commonly known
- This project is going to shout out the best company, the origin country will be a factor, but not a major one ([WARNING: Politics] unless it is a country currently involved in dangerously severe human rights abuses, such as China, Russia, North Korea, won't list any more countries here)

## Printer software I currently see hope for includes:

[:octocat: OpenPrinting](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/)

## Major enemies of the good printer:

- Canon
- Dell
- Epson
- HP

This isn't very much of an environmental process (paper = trees, ink = ink + plastic) but it kind of is at the same time (less hardware waste in landfills)
