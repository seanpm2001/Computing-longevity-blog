# Standard method for creating a desktop computer that can last 50+ years

A lot of current devices only are designed to last 1-4 years. This is a problem, as it makes it expensive to consistently own a computer, and it leads to electronic waste.

I want the world to have a computer that can easily last 10 years, and with careful usage, last 50 years or longer. It is doable, for example, the Nintendo Entertainment System is from the year 1985, and discontinued in 1995, but fully functional models are still fairly common 28 years later (as of 2023) we need to build computers that can last this long, and have this durability become common.

The computer should be able to last 50 years without half of the components requiring replacement.
