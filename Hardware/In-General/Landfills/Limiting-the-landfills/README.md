# Limiting the landfills

There is a huge environmental problem that has been established by Samsung, Google, Apple, and many other companies caused by a flawed business model of selling a new line of phones every year.

Originally, there were lots of improvements, but nowadays, nothing notable changes on the device except for the camera (the Samsung Galaxy S8, S9, S10, S20, S21, S22, and S23 are examples of this)

Due to (many, but not all) people buying new phones every year, the old phones are considered obsolete, and become electronic waste. Scale this with 2 billion people, and a yearly interval, and you can see that thousands of tons of metal is dumped into landfills every decade. These phones don't need to be tossed, this issue arises from planned obsolescence, and the right to repair, which must be tackled first.
