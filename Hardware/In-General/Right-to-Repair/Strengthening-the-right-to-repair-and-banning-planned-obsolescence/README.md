# Strengthening the right to repair and banning planned obsolescence

The right to repair is one of the most important rights regarding computer hardware. Unfortunately, it is being trampled on, so that new devices can be created and sold yearly (see: limiting the landfills) there are 2 major battles here:

- The right to repair
- Government ban of planned obsolescence

## What is the right to repair?

The right to repair is the right that when you purchase a device from a company, you can take it to anyone (not just its manufacturer or seller) and have it be repaired for a reasonable cost, so that the device can continue being used.

Unfortunately, a lot of companies don't like the right to repair, as it prevents them from selling excess hardware. Examples include Apple using overly complex and rare mechanical parts (such as very uncommon bolts) on its iPhone, or Windows 11 "forcing" people to buy a much more expensive computer.

## What is planned obsolescence?

Planned obsolescence is the practice of selling a computer (notably a cellular phone/"smart" phone) with software that is designed to make the device become slower and unusable over a duration of (commonly) 1-4 years, so that users are enticed to buy the latest phone when it comes out. Some forms of planned obsolescence make the device stop working a decade after the operating system is installed (not related to the UNIX [Y2K38 bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) or the Windows [Y2K bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem))
